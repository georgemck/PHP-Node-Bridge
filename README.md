# PHP-Node-Bridge

This project is a test of using a shared web hosting service with SSH access to sideload NodeJS and send data into a NodeJS app using PHP form variables. The form data is sent to NodeJS using argument variables and returned back to PHP by console logging a JSON object, which is then printed to the screen.

There are two versions. The second version uses asynchronous PHP via ReactPHP installed by Composer.
